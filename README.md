# SMS-SPAM_DETECTION
Objective:
* Develop a system to detect and filter spam SMS messages to improve user experience and security.

Tech Stack:

Programming Languages:
1. Python (for primary development and machine learning tasks)
2. Libraries & Frameworks:
Scikit-learn: For building and training machine learning models
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing
NumPy: For numerical operations
NLTK / SpaCy: For natural language processing and text analysis
TensorFlow / Keras: For advanced machine learning models (optional, if using deep learning)
Flask/streamlit For developing a web interface or API (if applicable)
BeautifulSoup / Scrapy: For web scraping (if gathering data from online sources)
Docker: For containerizing the application
Heroku / AWS / Azure: For deploying the application in the cloud
Version Control:
Git: For version control and collaboration


Approach:
1.Data Collection: Gather a dataset of SMS messages, labeled as spam or not spam.
2.Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data using NLP techniques.
3.Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the text for model training.
4.Model Training: Build and train classification models to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages.
5.Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6.Deployment: Implement the trained model in a production environment to filter incoming SMS messages.
